DOCUMENTATION
This app lets the user learn about spurious correlations. Those can arise in 2 independant samples. 
This app lets the user pick the sample size and the types of distributions to sample from, and it shows a linear relationship between them.

Any linear relationship shown is spurious as the distributions are independant and the samples drawn randomly.
